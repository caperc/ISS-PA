**Quick Start**
===============

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the `ISSPA source code <https://github.com/chenhengwei1999/ISSPA>`_
and how PA (Pyhsical Agents) are launched! Specifically, the following sections are included:

- Developing Environment

- WorkSpace Setup


Developing Environment
----------------------

We recommend using **Ubuntu 20.04** as your development system, ROS1 noetic is the version we use at the moment, 
and we will upgrade to ROS2 later in our work.

- Ubuntu 20.04

- ROS1 noetic

The following are some of the dependent libraries that need to be installed before the program can be compiled and run:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install libuvc-dev libgoogle-glog-dev ros-noetic-costmap-2d ros-noetic-nav-core libceres-dev

WorkSpace Setup
---------------

`ISSPA <https://github.com/chenhengwei1999/ISSPA/>`_ as our main repository, it is recommended that you first understand its directory structure, 
which is necessary for later use and development.

.. image:: ../imgs/github_mark.png
  
   :target: https://github.com/chenhengwei1999/ISSPA/
   :alt: GitHub Repository
   :align: center
   :width: 20%

First, clone the source code to the ``/home/$USER/`` directory:

.. code-block:: bash

  cd /home/$USER
  git clone https://github.com/chenhengwei1999/ISSPA.git

Next, use ``catkin_make`` to compile the workspace.

.. code-block:: bash
  
  cd /home/$USER/ISSPA
  catkin_make

.. note::

    **Hints:** You can also use ``catkin_make_isolated`` or ``catkin`` for compilation. ROS provides a number of compilation tools, the differences and advantages 
    of which are described at :doc:`here </appendix/compilation_tools>`.

When executing ``catkin_make``, you may encounter some problems. Common **Issues & Troubleshooting** can be found :doc:`here </appendix/issue_and_troubleshooting>`.

.. note::

   **Warm reminder:** Please remember to refresh the environment variables before using the program.
   Alternatively, storing them in ```~/.bashrc`` is fine.

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd /home/$USER/ISSPA
      source devel/setup.bash

      # echo "source ~/ISSPA/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
